[2025-12-10T16:12:39+05:30] Action: EXPLAIN | Payload: To summarize the system you typically query a set of key metrics: CPU usage (e.g., sum by (instance) (rate(node_cpu_seconds_total[5m]))), memory availability (node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes), disk usage (node_filesystem_avail_bytes), network traffic (rate(node_network_receive_bytes_total[5m]) and rate(node_network_transmit_bytes_total[5m])), and service health (up). A single PromQL query cannot meaningfully "summarize all metrics"; you need to run multiple queries or a recording rule that aggregates the most important ones. Combine the results in your dashboard or CLI to get a full picture.

[2025-12-10T16:14:01+05:30] Action: EXPLAIN | Payload: To summarize the system by checking all metrics and providing percentages, you can start by listing all metric names with a query like `{__name__=~".+"}`. However, calculating a percentage requires a reference value (e.g., total capacity, max value, or sum of related metrics). Without a specific denominator, generic percentages cannot be derived. If you define the reference for each metric (e.g., CPU usage as a percentage of total CPU, memory usage as a percentage of total memory), you can then use PromQL expressions such as `100 * (metric_name / reference_metric)` to compute the percentages. Provide the reference metrics or the context you want percentages relative to, and I can craft the exact PromQL queries for you.
